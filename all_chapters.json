The amount owed plus the added interest is then payable in full in circumstances such as death, or permanent vacation or sale of the mortgaged property.”; “Warning: Unlike certain other mortgages where interest is charged on a sum that decreases with time, interest on lifetime mortgages is charged on an increasing sum (made up of the outstanding mortgage and added interest amounts), and therefore the total amount owed can increase quickly. As you are not required to make any scheduled repayments, the interest on your mortgage is added to your outstanding debt on a continual basis and you are effectively charged interest on that interest. This is called ‘compound interest’.”; “Warning: The longer a lifetime mortgage remains unpaid, the more money you will owe and the amount you owe could eventually come close to, equal, or exceed, the value of the mortgaged residential property.”; “Warning: The longer a lifetime mortgage remains unpaid, the more money you will owe and the amount you owe could eventually come close to or equal, the value of the mortgaged residential property.”; “Warning: Purchasing this product may negatively impact on your ability to fund future needs.

The amount owed plus the added interest is then payable in full in circumstances such as death, or permanent vacation or sale of the mortgaged property.”; “Warning: Unlike certain other mortgages where interest is charged on a sum that decreases with time, interest on lifetime mortgages is charged on an increasing sum (made up of the outstanding mortgage and added interest amounts), and therefore the total amount owed can increase quickly. As you are not required make any scheduled repayments, the interest on your mortgage is added to your outstanding debt on a continual basis and you are effectively charged interest on that interest. This is called ‘compound interest’.”; “Warning: the rate of interest applied to your loan balance may increase and the amount you owe will increase as a result.”; “Warning: The longer a lifetime mortgage remains unpaid, the more money you will owe and the amount you owe could eventually come close to, equal, or exceed the value of the mortgaged residential property.”; “Warning: The longer a lifetime mortgage remains unpaid, the more money you will owe and the amount you owe could eventually come close to or equal, the value of the mortgaged residential property.”; “Warning: Purchasing this product may negatively impact on your ability to fund future needs. Before purchasing this product, you should get independent legal or financial advice.”; “Warning: You will have to pay charges if you pay off a lifetime mortgage early.”."
